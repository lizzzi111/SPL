Published in: Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''School Performance Forecasting''

Description: 'Provides the functionality of checking whether the data contains variables that correlation is higher than a given threshold, looks for variables with variance close to zero. Looks for duplicates, if specified. In the end returns a list variable: nearZerovars - names of variables with small variance (if found), summary - contains a descriptive summary of the data set, correlation - pearson correlation table of numeric variables, highlyCorPredictors - pairs of names of highly correlated variables'
