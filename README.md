„Comparative Analysis of statistical techniques of nominative and numerical data“

The work will have the following character:

We develop functions that can make statistical analysis easier for people who are not to 100% confident with theoretical part (e.g. which test to use when).
The functions will be check the criteria for analyses and employ the respective method.

It will be divided into two parts:
dealing with nominative and numerical data

and within each group we are going to present the following tasks

- Descriptive
- Comparing samples, groups (anova, t-test, chi-square and their assumptions)
- Regression and its assumptions (and work arounds if assumptions do not hold)
- Forecasting

Moreover visualisation will be provided for each part

(interactive with plotly + for printing)
