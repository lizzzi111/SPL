School Performance Forecasting: A Data Mining Approach

The work is based on the paper "Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance."
In the following repo replication of this study is provided:
prediction of school performance of students, of Math and Portuguese classes, using their sociometric and behavioral characteristics.

Moreover, some extensions are added:
e.g. comparison of the setting of the variables given in the paper to the settings obtained using Feature Importance techniques.

Predictions are made in 3 types: regression, binary and multiclass classification

     Note: for appropriate functioning of quantlets, one should start either by working from the Paper.Rproj project or by setting the  working directory to "./SPL/". All the paths in quantlets are set relatively to this working directory.
