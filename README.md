„Comparative Analysis of statistical techniques of nominative and numerical data“

The work will have the following character:

we develop functions that can make statistical analysis easier for people who are not 100% confident with theoretical part.
The functions will be check the criteria for analyses and employ the respective method.

It will be divided into two parts:
nominative and numerical data

and within each group we are going to present the following tasks

- Descriptive
- Comparing samples, groups (anova, t-test, chi-square and their assumptions)
- Regression and its assumptions (and work arounds if assumptions do not hold)
- Forecasting

Moreover visualisation will be provided for each part
