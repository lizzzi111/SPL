The functions will be check the criteria for analyses and employ the respective method.

It will be divided into two parts:
nominal and numerical data

and within each group we are going to present the following tasks

- Descriptive
- Comparing samples, groups (anova, t-test, chi-square and their assumptions)
- Regression and its assumptions (and work arounds if assumptions do not hold)
- forecasting

Moreover visualisation will be provided for each part
